# WebCrawler
Purely for education and portfolio purposes - pulls home data from realtor website.

Using ScraperAPI, I built this Python program to pull data from a realtor website to view what houses are for sale without going to the webpage itself.
The data gets converted into a CSV file using Pandas for better visualization and manipulation.

To view data, just open the file ending in '_PropertyResults.csv'
