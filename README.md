# WebScraper
Purely for education and portfolio purposes - pulls home data from realtor website.

Using ScraperAPI, I built this Python program to pull data from a realtor website to view what houses are for sale without going to the webpage itself.
The data gets converted into a CSV file using Pandas for better visualization and manipulation.

To run, first run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

(Optional) To change city location, on 'main.py' line 6 change 'city' property to whatever city you'd like, just be sure to capitalize and add a hypen between words

then run 'python main.py'

To view data, just open the file ending in '_PropertyResults.csv'

# Note:
Sometimes program may crash or unexpected error may appear. Just run again, usually does the trick.
